In the experiment we study properties and usages of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Firstly we measure the characteristic relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. This later was estimated with the Hahn echo and Carr-Purcell sequence. Both methods are compared. Secondly we used NMR to identify substances using with help of the characteristic chemical shift using TMS as reference substance. Lastly NRM was used for 1 dimensional and 2 dimensional imaging.

\section{Critical Discussion}
%resumÃ© of experiment.
The goal of the experiment is to study and get familiar with the theory and implementations of nuclear magnetic resonance. For that we studied two methods to measure the spin-spin relaxation time and one to estimate the spin-lattice relaxation time. Later we identify 5 probes by measuring the relative chemical shift, here we used TMS as reference substance. Next, we use NMR for imaging. In this last part we first get familiar with the machine by taking 1 dimensional scans, then we use 1 dimensional imaging to determine the nature of the time evolution of a system. Finally we use 2D imaging to map different objects and its structures.
