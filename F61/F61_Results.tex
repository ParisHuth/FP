\section{Results}
\subsection{Relaxation time}
The variation of parameter $\tau$ in the spin-echo and 180째-90째 sequence allowed us to measure the time evolution of the transverse 
(Fig. \ref{fig:GD500 T2 Sp} \& Fig. \ref{fig:GD600 T2 Sp})
 and anti-parallel magnetization (Fig. \ref{fig:GD500 T1} \& Fig. \ref{fig:GD600 T1}). A second measurement for the transverse component using the Carr-Purcell sequence delivered Fig. \ref{fig:GD500 T2 CP} \& Fig. \ref{fig:GD600 T2 CP}.

A quick glance at the curves tells us that the time evolution of the components of the magnetization is described by decay curves, as we expected from the solutions of the bloch equations (eq.\ref{eq: sol. bloch T1} \& eq. \ref{eq: sol. bloch T2}). By fitting these equation to our data, we were able to find the characteristic relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. The results of the measurements are summarized in Tab. \ref{tab: relaxation times}. Here the fourth column, deviation $\sigma$, represents the deviation from the methods used to measure $T_2$:
$$\sigma := \frac{|T_{2, sp. echo} - T_{2, CP}|}{\sqrt{\Delta T_{2,sp. echo}^2 + \Delta T_{2,CP}}}.$$
\begin{table}[!htbp]
 \begin{center}
  \caption{Relaxation times for Gd500 and Gd600}
  \label{tab: relaxation times}
  \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Probe}} & $T_2$ [ms]& $T_2$ [ms]&\multirow{2}{*}{deviation $\sigma$} &\multirow{2}{*}{ spin-lattice $T_1$[ms]}\\
	& spin-echo & Carr-Purcell &  &\\
	\hline
	\hline	
	Gd 500 & 110 $\pm$ 6 & 111,3 $\pm$ 1,5 & 0,5 & 159 $\pm$ 1,3 \\
	Gd 600 & 115,7 $\pm$ 1,2 & 116,9 $\pm$ 0,9 & 0,8 & 154,4 $\pm$ 1,2 \\
	\hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

Firstly, we observe that the spin-spin relaxation time of the probe with lower density, Gd600, is larger than that of Gd500, as expected. From our theory we know that $T_2$ is mainly determined by the interaction between the proton's spins. Hence the bigger the concentration, which translates to a larger amount of protons therefore of spins, the  more possibilities there exist for a proton to dissipate its excitation energy resulting in a smaller spin-spin relaxation time. 

Secondly we observe that $T_{1, Gd500} > T_{1,Gd600}$, which contradicts our expectations. Analogously to the case of $T_2$, a higher concentration also translates in a smaller spin-lattice relaxation time, since the excited state has a larger lattice in which it can dissipates its energy. This expectations also arise from the known paramagnetic characteristics of Gd, which enhance the local magnetic field. Hence the interaction with Gd-atoms result in a shorter relaxation. 


From our experiment we can observe that the deviation between the results gained by the spin-echo and Carr-Purcell methods are not significant, however from our theory we know that this second method delivers more exact results. The Carr-Purcell sequence is also a faster measurement technique, since it can be completely automatized, thus reducing the susceptibility to human errors. Lastly we also observe a higher precision from this second method, it delivers a smaller uncertainty in all measurements. This last point is better observed by the measurements of Gd500 where the uncertainty of the spin-echo method is almost 4 times bigger than the one delivered by the Carr-Purcell sequence.

The measured relative distances between the maximum of TMS and the active groups of the probes are in Tab. \ref{tab: identification} along with the names of the molecule matching the identified active groups.
\begin{table}[!htbp]
 \begin{center}
  \caption{ Measured relative chemical and identification of probes}
  \label{tab: identification}
  \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
 	\multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Probe}} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Relative distance $\Delta$ [ppm]} &\multirow{2}{*}{ \textbf{Substance}} \\
								   &	 $\Delta_1$ & $\Delta_2$ &  $\Delta_3$ & \\
\hline
\hline
 	A & 2,3 & 4,1 & 6,8& fluroacetone \\
 	B & 2,5 & 7,2 & - & p-xylol \\
 	C & 2,2 & 11,8& - & acetic acid \\
 	D & 4,1 & 6,5 & - & fluroacetonitril \\
 	E & 2,3 & 7,1 & - & toluol \\
 	\hline
  \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

In the given list of molecules,see Fig. \ref{fig: identification}, we notice that fluroacetone is the only molecule with three maxima in its spectrum, since given its chemical components with one maximum corresponding to $CH_3$ and two lines for the $FH_2$ group. This line splitting arise from the extra magnetic energy given to this component. Therefore to identify probe A there is no need to measure the relative distances $\Delta_i$, instead a qualitative study of its spectrum (Fig. \ref{fig:sample A}) is sufficient to identify it as fluroacetone. 
A study of the measured relative chemical shift of $D$ shows that it contains the 2 lines from the $FH_2$ group, which leads us to identify it as fluroacetonitril.  
On the other hand, we can see in Tab. \ref{tab: identification} that probes $B$ and $E$ have the same active groups, however we see a higher intensity in the peak corresponding to the active group $CH_3$ in the spectra of probe $B$ (Fig. \ref{fig: B}) in comparison to that shown in $E$'s spectra (Fig. \ref{fig: E}). With this observation we are able to identify substance $B$ as p-xylol and $E$ as toluol. 
Lastly we identify probe $C$ as acetic acid due to the big chemical shift $\Delta_2$, which is caused by the active group $COOH$.
\subsection{Imaging}
\paragraph{1 dimensional imaging}
The signal obtained by a vertical imaging of two probes containing the same oil, but which differ in vertical extend and positioning, show disparities (see Fig. \ref{fig: long and short oil}). In the vial with less volume we see a constant signal, with some noise on top of it, meanwhile we observe a increase in the signal of the vial with higher volume of oil in range $x < -15$ mm and $x > 15$ mm. This change in the measured signal is an effect caused by the non-linearity of the field gradient. It is know that the applied magnetic field is not perfectly linear. In conclusion, the probes have to be set in a position $x \in [-15$ mm, $15$ mm$]$ in order to minimize the the effect of non-linearity of the field gradient.

 \caption{1 dimensional NMRI of 2 oil samples. Blue line: short oil sample, green line: long oil sample}
    \label{fig: long and short oil}
   \end{center}
 \end{figure} 
 
Secondly, we insert a probe containing oil and a piece of Teflon. The measured vertical profile (see Fig. \ref{fig:teflon}) shows a pattern of peaks and valleys, revealing the structure of the teflon piece. Since it does not emit an NMR signal, the pattern implies the piece consisting of stacked Teflon plates. The valleys correspond to the presence of said plates. In these areas the signal is not zero, since there still oil around the probe which does emit a NMR signal. On the other hand, the peaks represent the areas where the plates are bonded to one another, and due to the higher volume of oil present in such areas, the measured signal is stronger.

    \label{fig:teflon}
   \end{center}
 \end{figure} 
\paragraph{Time evolution of system}
The vertical profile was measured 96 times. The NRM signals Nr $ 1,10, 30, 50, 96$ are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:time evolution system}. In this diagram we observe how the position curve develops a concavity. We remember that a diffusion process is described by the equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
\end{equation}
Here $D$ represents a constant which is always greater than zero. We further notice that since the concentration in the left part of the graph increases the time derivative must be positive. So, for the differential equation to be satisfied the spacial curve should be convex, i.e the second derivative should also be positive, which clearly is not the case. Therefore we conclude that the oil pouring down through the sand is not a diffusion process. Instead, the found time evolution is proper of a percolation process, which describes the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials.

 \end{figure}
\paragraph{2 dimensional imaging}
%For the 2D imaging we used a steam of celery, a peanut and a pecan peanut. 
To get familiar with the measuring set up we started by taking horizontal and vertical scans of a vial filled with oil, see Fig. \ref{fig:oil horizontal} \& \ref{fig:oil vertical}. As expected, the measured signals are constant at the position of the probe tube, thus the images show the geometry of the used probe tube. 

When studying a peanut, we first observed that due to the lack of water or fat in the nut's shell, it does not emit enough NMR. Hence, in the taken scan we can only see the inner structures of the peanut. In the scan Fig. \ref{fig:nut vertical} one can observe both nuts and the air gap between the two halves of the nut in the upper one. This gap can also be seen, with less resolution in the horizontal scan, see Fig. \ref{fig:nut horizontal}.

Analogously if we place a pecan in the NMRI device, the shell does not emit enough NMR signal, thus we can only see the inner nut. See Fig. \ref{fig:pecan}. 

Lastly we place a celery in the NMR machine, its horizontal profile can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:celery}. There we can see the C-shape of the branch. In the inner of the celery we also see slightly darker spots, which corresponds to holes filled with water. These spots are better visible in range $y \in [5, 20]$, however the resolution still not ideal.
